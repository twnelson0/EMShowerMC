/*
Outline
	* In this simplified model I will consider incident e-e+ particles on the calorimeter from the decay volume
	* Since these are the product of the decay of LLPs where in the decay volume they originate will be a exponentially random value with average of LLP lifetime
	* The angle of incidence of the LLP (and therefore the e+e-) will be a uniformly generated value within FASERs 2mrad acceptance
	* After each radiation length a given particle will lose half its energy
	* After 1 rad len a charged lepton will yield a photon and a charged lepton (Bremstralung)
	* After 1 rad len a photon will yield an electron positron pair (Pair production with nuclei really)
	* In principle pair production of photons should only happen every 9/7 Rad Len
	* In principle process for leptons stops at E_c and process stops for photons when E < 2m_e
	* When particles split I'm not sure how to handle direction, in principle if I consider a psudo 1d model all that matters is that energy splits in 2 mometa and location in detector irelevent
	* Negate more detailed interactions
	* In more detailed simulation when interaction occurs and resultent energies and directions should be more accuretly obtained from process cross section

Magnets will pull them apart
